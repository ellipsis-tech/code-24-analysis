### Analysis

We incur the maximum number of `search` calls when we search for the largest query inside the 2K-ST / or the inorder predecessor of the root node in the 2K-ST.

Using the example of the largest 2K-ST node, we need to search through the list of $K$ children each time, which incurs a recursive call for each child, when only the last child is the child that would find the largest query. 

Hence, the recurrence relation is 

$$
T(N) = K\cdot T(\frac{N}{2K}) + \Theta{(1)}
$$

At each step of the recursion, we have $2K$ subproblems, but we only need to explore $K$ of them (which is all the elements inside the list `childrenLarger`) at each iteration step. 

For an input size of $N$ KST nodes, and we divide by $2K$ at each step, there are $\log_{2K}N$ steps to get to the lowest level of the tree.

Hence, the number of `search` calls is approximately:

$$
K\cdot \log_{2K} N
$$

Hence, the answer is `D`.
