## Analysis

At iteration $i$, **For loop B** runs $\frac{N}{4^i}$ times.
This means that the total number of times **For Loop B** runs is

$$
\frac{N}{4^0} + \frac{N}{4^1} + \frac{N}{4^2} + \cdots + \frac{N}{4^{\log_{4}N}} = N\sum_{i=0}^{\log_4{N}}4^{-i} \text{ times}
$$

This evaluates to:
$$
N\sum_{i=0}^{\log_4{N}}4^{-i} 
= N[\frac{1-0.25^{(\log_{4}{N}+1)}}{1-0.25}] 
= N[\frac{1}{0.75} - \frac{0.25(4^{-\log_{4}{N}})}{0.75}] \\ 
= N[\frac{4}{3} - \frac{4^{-\log_{4}{N}}}{3}] 
= N[\frac{4}{3} - \frac{1}{3N}] = \frac{4N-1}{3}
$$

Note that $N = 4^k$ for some integer $k$, and it can be shown that 3 divides $4(4^k)-1 = 4^{k+1}-1$ by [induction](https://www.quora.com/How-can-you-prove-that-4-n-1-is-divisible-by-3-using-induction). 

Hence the answer is option `H` for 200 points.

### Potential Mistake
Note that there is a possible error, which is to assume that the sum is a sum to infinity. In that case, then they would use the limit of sum of a convergence series formula, which will lead them to the wrong answer: 

$$
N\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}4^{-i} = N \sum_{i=0}^{\infty}[\frac{1}{4}]^{i} = N[\frac{1}{1-0.25}] = \frac{4N}{3}
$$

This method will lead them to select option `I`.

Participants who selected option `I` get 100 points.
